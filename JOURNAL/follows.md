thoughts while brainstorming how to do follows
  - [[February 19th, 2024]]
    - will need ability to follow all permutations of an Emote. Ex:
        1) get notifs of all emotes from specific sender, specific symbol, specific receiver
        2) get notifs of all emotes from specific sender, ambiguous symbol, specific receiver
        3) you get the point
    - dont think i need to worry about this in beginning, but eventually a follow should have options so it's not just "ALL EMOTES" and that is customizable
