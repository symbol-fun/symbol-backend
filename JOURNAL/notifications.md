thoughts while brainstorming how to do notifications
  - [[February 17th, 2024]]
    - gonna need a new notificiations table
    - gonna need a follow/subscription table - i think i like follow name better in case subscription used later for money thing (mind changed later on this)
    - if symbol sent to user, then they get notification. if spammy, the frontend will fix the spam UX. But, backend will store all sent symbols as much as possible. There will be tight limits in beginning due to money basically - so ill just pick a limit and when hit - the sending user will no longer be able to send symbols.
    - what about if symbol is sent that user follows? this made me realize i dont think follows are needed - at least in beginning
    - instead of follows, there will be notification button on symbol of user where you can change how you receive that symbol from that user. default is to receive all. Really this would just be setting in DB that controls frontend UX - but no data storage of notifs is really changing.
    - i guess ill do notification viewed functionality same way X does it. Something about it i dont like, but seems easiest
    - for now, this notification table will only store notifs for emotes. one day there will be notifs for other things to. maybe ill name emotenotif then to prepare

    - i pondered on if notif should really be sent out with every emote with receiverSymbol that is any potential X user - and i think i resolved to yes. Bc otherwise there will be no way for the user to mark each received symbol as directlySeen or casuallySeen either - which could be a fun aspect - especially the direct one imo
    - the main other option is to only send out if user has logged in at least once to Emote or done at least one action on Emote - but then all their past emotes will not have any notifications for marking SEEN or na
    - kinda makes me wonder if hasReadCasually and hasReadDirectly could be on the EMOTE itself. I dont really see any reason why not but also it's late and about to fall asleep so brain no work - and intuition says daz not da way. Maybe because then you'd be updating Emotes and im uncertain i wanna do that or na - even if just a few fields.
