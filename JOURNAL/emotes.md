thoughts while brainstorming on how to structure emote data structure
  [[February 21st, 2024]]
    - well i made receiverSymbol an array that can have multiple symbols. but then i realized you could do the same with the symbol sent. so i wondered why not make that an array. but what is even the difference from a user perspective? and why not just do both? what i mean is - user can send multiple symbols stored in one array in 1 Emote triplet AND they can send a completely different Emote triplet IN SAME SEND ACTION. But when would that ever happen and is that too much customizability? Rn only weird example my mind can think of is: you send ['hug', 'poke'] to ['fren1', 'fren2'] and you send ['fuck u', 'ur stoopid'] to 'asshole1' - all in one SEND action - which means 2 DB records with same timestamp
