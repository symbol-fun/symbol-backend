HOW TOS
  - how to get this thing started
    - copy over packages needed from ceramic-ai demo into package.json and also copy over the scripts needed (the literal files and the commands into package.json)
    - create your composites folder and files
    - fix composites.mjs for your new composites 
    - gotta run cmd in admin and then install
    - npm run generate
    - fix composedb.config.json by changing all "\\" to "/" and remove any redundant ".ceramic" in path
    - if you get error message about ipfs lock, just delete the .ceramic folder
